### Markdown

> What is Markdown?
>> It is a simple markup language for writers

___

> Why use Markdown?
>> Writers prefer Markdown over more convenient software like Microsoft Office Word with much more capabilities because it doesn't inhibit their *writing flow*

>> Which is quite important for ***writers***

___

> What is my opinion on Markdown?
>> I do like the idea of simplicity but as a someone who does not write books or blogs for a living, I would say that I much prefer HTML for practical use.

>> I do enjoy *styling* and *interactive* part of webpages so...

### Studying Routine

#### Why study?
- The whole process of studying was perceived to be quite dull, meaningless act few years ago.
- However, in retrospect, I realize how fool ish I had been to be carrying such an idea. I regret that I had wasted so much time not learning in my childhood for I could have been at a much different(pleasant) place right now.
- Now I truly believe studying and learning in general is probably the singular thing that makes life less miserable.
- Studying is probably equivalent to air, food, socializing as our chance of survival depends on it in this current era.
- Studying broadens your perspective, field of expertise and knowledge, from which our possibility of life of higher quality blooms.
- So if one is irrational enough to believe that intelligence is not important in this time, then he should expect a life that is fruitful of misery and angst.

#### How should you study?
- Some people would argue that a question of what to study should precede how to study. I truly believe that nothing is not worth studying. Also such question is greatly subjective. So skipping such question will only save us from wasting unnecessary amount of time.
- Scott Young, famous for finishing MIT's Bachelor degree as a Computer Science major within a year and also an elaborate researcher on a topic of learning effectively, claimed that a students should keep in mind a five different concepts if their motive is to study effectively.

    1. ***Introduction***
        - This is where you read books, or listen to lectures, activities that introduce you to new ways of doing things. The reason is that you might want to stand on the shoulders of giants. You can spend couple of years trying to come up with theory of relativity from scratch on your own and you might learn a thing or two along the way but you are doing that at a cost of much greater things.
        - Also, in this phase, you need to make the task as much active as possible. Only doing so will result in learning. There is no point in filling up a leaky bucket.
    1. ***Retrieval***
        - Here you try to solidify what you learned in **Introduction** stage. Ways of sticking new information to memory are solving similar problems, associating the new to older and more fundamental information, and, as mentioned before, making the task as active as possible during the **Introduction** phase.
    1. ***Spacing***
        - You can study as much as you want but the end result is the crucial thing here so you have to be strategical when it comes to learning. Research after research, proved that cramming results much less learning than short study sessions spaced-out evenly.
    1. ***Understanding***
        > The easiest person you can fool is yourself
        - Most of us mistake we understood a certain concept until we try to explain them to other people.
        - Richard Feynman, American physicist, popularized Feynman technique which totally aids our such problem. After every **Introduction** phase, you should check to see if you truly understood using *Feynman technique*.
        - You bring out a piece of paper and try to explain the concept as if you are teaching it to a six-year-old. When you come across a detail you can't explain or remember, the method is working and you go back to your book and re-learn.

    1. ***Feedback***
        - I think this is the part that most of the effectiveness of learning takes place that most people tend to ignore.
        - Receiving feedback from people more experienced than you not only solves your mistakes but also give you useful advice so that you are directed on the most effective path to mastery.
