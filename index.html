	<h1>Derek's Train of Thought</h1>

		<h3 class="acc">About</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				Here, I let out the cascade of thoughts that is eating me from inside.
			</p>
			<p>
				As of January 2021, I am 19 years old and I study Computer Science in Polish, in which language that I can barely share a sentence with anyone. So yeah, as of now, my life is looking pretty fucking ugly and I am sorry to welcome you and tell you why it all sucks.
			</p>
			<p>
				By the way, I follow Gary Vaynerchuk on social media sites and most importantly in life. I try to take his advice to heart and so that should explain the excessive use of curse words and just common sense writing mistakes.

		<h3 class="acc">Tough conversation I should've had with my parents in 2017</h3>
		<div>
			<p>
				Hey. Whats going on?
			</p>
			<p>
				It is 02:09 late in the night. My sleep cycle is completely fucked up but who cares when your executing the crap out
				during the period when your awake.
			</p>
			<p>
				So anyway, i was drawn into this really fascinating loud
				conversation that Garyvee was having with this caller and some indian comedian. They were yelling about being a fan
				of
				houston rockets or cleveland cavaliers. Gary was literally slamming the phone and yelling deep down from his lungs.
				Anyway, with that curiosity risen in me, i listened more intently and as i listened the conversation turned out to
				contain much more wisdom than just plain heated debate over basketball. This guy is 28 and hes south asian and due
				to
				that, his parents literally own his life decisions like who to marry and what to do for a living. However, our guy
				managed to leave the nest and get an apartment on his own but struggle to make the ends meet so he does this nine to
				five kind of job which sucks the life out of him and then on the other side he is passionate about filmmaking and
				shit
				and so since hes out of thick cash support he has a side project on that filmmaking thing and does every job. He
				casts,
				edits, acts, writes, and sells and markets. My mans all about hustling and following Garys advices to heart but he
				admits that he gets burned out. Anyway gary took the answer and just let himself loose. What he said was to go back
				home
				and start saving cash. Go and tell your parents go fuck themselves and see them in ten years.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its just gain a
				perspective and see long term instead of short term kinf of advice. I mean this one is really popular advice that i
				know
				by heart but the reason why i wanted to write it down was because it felt so relatable to me. Im sorry i might have
				to
				diss my parents here but yeah fuck them. The moment gary was spitting those truth,i kept thinking why in the fuck i
				didnt take these advice personally when i watched similar video in 2018 when i had just graduated from high school
				and
				that i was firm on not studying in university. Goddamn, why the fuck did i even went to study in that shitty
				mongolian
				national university for a year. What a fucking waste of time and money. And im still fucking wasting my time and
				money
				here as well. Just fucking around. Literally wasting time and money here. Not consuming any knowledge, not even
				being
				able to understand anything being taught. Literally learning everything for free from the internet instead of from
				the
				teachers. And then letting these goddamn lessons suck the life out of me every single day and constantly helping
				this
				habit of letting my own subconscious believe deeply that im worthless piece of shit. Goodluck with that self esteem
				shit. I mean. Im just trying to say that i shouldve the moment i watched similar video went up to my parents and had
				that tough conversation upfront. However it is true that i gotta be smart about the approach as well since u will be
				living under their houses roof and eating their food for next few years right.
			</p>
			<p>
				So i shouldve just said mom dad i love
				you and i know that u guys love me as well and that u wish only the best for me but i just dont want to study in
				university. Ok so this conversation is going to be really tough one but hear me out. Im not saying that i dont wanna
				go
				to university because its boring and hard but rather because its pure waste of time and i will not be challenged
				enough
				and i know for fact that the chance of me getting led astray from what i truly need is enormous. I know what i want
				to
				do for a living. I found out how i can find that thing i will doing for the rest of my life. I am young and i want
				to
				take advantage of that by experiencing different fields of life. I understand that u want to me to be a doctor,
				scientist, or any other office worker that works at this safe job where i work from nine to five in a pretty office
				within my own cubicle around colleagues that are like me but i willbe dreading every second of that life. So i cant
				even
				imagine the amount of hatred and resentment i will have accumulated towards as each day of my mid thirties passes
				towards u, because u have forced to choose that path instead of following my own passion where i am wondering every
				single day depressed going to work never knowing whether if ever had at least a tiny bit of chance of success if i
				had
				just tried going on the path that i wanted to go on. So u see, let us assume that i am living a comforrable safe
				life
				where i know where is my next income coming from and i have a roof over my head and i can afford a one or two
				luxuries a
				month but i can assure u that i will be miserable as hell. Im 30 years old and have a family now so that changing
				careers now is too damn risky so i am literally stuck in this dead end path of life. Now to whom do u think i will
				point
				fingers when i try to analyze how the fuck i have ended up in this shithole. None other than you. My dearest,
				closest
				people i have in my entire life. Mom and dad. U know how hard it is to hold a grudge against your close friend who
				betrayed u right. U never ever want to see them again. But what about family. I mean, i dont even think i would be
				even
				able to look at your faces. I would be just too damn depressed all the time, overwhelmed by this work that i hate
				doing
				but have to since thats my only way out of ending up in streets. Every day, every night, i would be haunted by these
				nightmarish thoughts of what ifs. What if i decided to follow my own path and succeeded and instead of these fucked
				up
				documents i have to prepare for this douchebag of a boss i have at work i might be actually all giddied up and fired
				up
				to go to work the next day doing what i love for a living. Alright, but then what if i failed and didnt succeed,
				then
				who cares im 22 and i dont have a family of my own and i can start fresh from something else. But its super hard to
				find
				no success from chasing something u love. When u truly love doing something. When u are actually addicted to the
				process
				of working, then your destined to find success as long as your patient. But what is that success, the thing that is
				being defined as the end goal, something being valued more important than the day to day process. At the end of the
				day
				isnt life all about being happy and pleased with what u have. Whats the point of being the richest person of the
				world
				but u hate every second of being awake.
			</p>
			<p>
				Anyway, i really wish i had this talk way before graduating with my parents. Then who knows what would i be doing
				right
				now. See. This fucking thing called regret is deadly. It fucking hurts more than anything in the world because u
				cant
				take back time. I am now even carrying slight dose of regret and it fucking stings. Its the most pain ive ever
				experienced in my entire life and god knows how many times ive been sick and close to conscious numbing sickness.
